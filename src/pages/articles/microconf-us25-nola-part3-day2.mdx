Day 2 was the only full day of speakers at the conference (absolutely love the focus on hallway tracks). Got there early in hopes of meeting up with [Josh Wood](https://bsky.app/profile/joshuawood.net) of [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/). Usually, that’s not too difficult to do, being that MicroConf isn’t too big. But we just couldn’t seem to find each other.

There were a bunch of wonderfully useful and insightful speakers on day 2, including some internet faves: 

[Rob Walling](https://bsky.app/profile/punchlinecopy.com) broke down the 7 SaaS Growth Plateaus that he’s documented and observed over the last couple of years of mentoring and talking to founders. Super insightful and helpful to know what to watch out for.

[Lianna Patch](https://bsky.app/profile/punchlinecopy.com): conference emcee, copywriter extraordinaire, and [business partner to Colleen](https://www.saasmarketinggym.com), gave us a funny and heartfelt reminder that utilizing feelings and emotion in our marketing copy is how we grab people and remind them that we too are real people just like them.

[Colleen Schnettler](https://bsky.app/profile/leenyburger.bsky.social), having [freshly come off a podcast chronicling her TinySeed journey and ultimate shutdown of HelloQuery](https://bsky.app/profile/leenyburger.bsky.social/post/3lipbpw2r5s2i) (an ai powered reporting tool that I was actually hoping to integrate into my self SaaS), showed (and ultimately convinced me) how to do a better job of leveraging LinkedIn - the social network we all love to hate on, but that is ultimately the only option that isn’t a total dumpster fire at the moment.

[Tracy Osborn](https://bsky.app/profile/tracyosborn.com) did an amazing job of stepping in for Einar Vollset’s micro talk on “Will AI Kill SaaS?” Really great to hear from people that are so entrenched with founders and seeing who’s getting affected the most. Just like other technological advancements before it, we as a species will advance and new opportunities will arise because of it. Huge opportunity for those who are nimble and able to adapt.

During the breakout sessions, [Jaakko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaakkopiipponen/) and I went for a lovely little walk and talked about business and saunas. It was fantastic.

To close out the event, I also got to catch most of [Marcos Riviera](https://x.com/PRICINGIO)’s talk on pricing. He broke down a ton of pricing and business model-related pitfalls and mistakes that were very helpful. He packed a ton of value into a short amount of time. I have a couple of things I’m going to make sure to implement soon myself.

After the talks, we went across the street for the closing reception at the beautiful World War II museum. Got some more time to chat with some new friends but then finally met up with [Josh](https://bsky.app/profile/joshuawood.net) and [Ben](https://bsky.app/profile/bencurtis.com) from [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/) and we went to grab some pizza at a local pizza joint a couple of blocks away, along with [Derrick Reimer](https://x.com/derrickreimer). Was great to finally meet and chat. I can’t tell you how often Honeybadger saves my bacon and catches errors for me. Truly an essential tool for my work.
